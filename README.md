# The Switcher

## Project Overview

"The Switcher" is a web-based card game designed for 2 to 4 players. Players can create or join various game rooms. Once the conditions are met and the host gives approval, the game will begin.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into two main parts:
- **back** (Backend)
- **front** (Frontend)

Each section operates independently and must be launched separately. Both have their own README files containing detailed instructions for setup and usage.

Additionally, both folders include their own set of development tests.
